# J2S - A JSON to Swift converter
A project I worked on for a Tome Lab Day.

# What does this do?
Takes an JSON model for an API call and builds Swift classes for it

## How to use
* Download repo
* Edit data variable to your JSON model
* Edit fileName to change the output fileName
* Edit className to the name of your object
* Run with `node j2s.js`
